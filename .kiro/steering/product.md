# Product Overview

Kirk is a trustless gaming protocol that combines Cashu ecash tokens with Nostr events for cryptographically-secured gameplay.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Trustless Gaming**: No central game server required - all gameplay is verifiable through cryptographic proofs
- **Decentralized Coordination**: Uses Nostr's decentralized event system for game coordination
- **Cryptographic Security**: All moves are cryptographically verifiable using Cashu token commitments
- **Flexible Framework**: Trait-based system supports different game implementations

## Key Components

- **Cashu Integration**: Uses ecash tokens for cryptographic game piece commitments and rewards
- **Nostr Events**: Coordinates gameplay through decentralized event publishing
- **Two Token Types**: Game-type ecash for gameplay commitments, Reward-type ecash for winners
- **Commit-and-Reveal**: Strategic decisions use cryptographic commitments for simultaneous play

## Target Users

- **Game Developers**: Building trustless games using cryptographic commitments
- **Players**: Participating in provably fair games without trusting central authorities
- **Mint Operators**: Acting as game authorities for validation and reward distribution
- **Validators**: Third parties who can independently verify game outcomes

## Named After

Charlie Kirk, a free speech advocate - reflecting the protocol's commitment to decentralized, trustless systems.

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical production readiness issues identified in the senior engineer analysis of the Kirk gaming protocol. The analysis revealed several high-priority concerns including error handling vulnerabilities, missing test infrastructure, and security gaps that must be resolved before production deployment. This specification focuses on hardening the existing codebase to meet production standards while maintaining the innovative trustless gaming functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Kirk protocol to handle errors gracefully without panicking, so that the system remains stable and provides meaningful error information in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any function encounters an error condition THEN the system SHALL return a proper Result type instead of using .unwrap() or .expect()
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log structured error information using a proper logging framework instead of eprintln!
3. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs and return descriptive error messages for invalid data
4. IF a network operation fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN handling timeouts THEN the system SHALL use configurable timeout values instead of hardcoded constants

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all critical functionality, so that I can confidently deploy changes and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN all cryptographic functions SHALL have property-based tests to verify security properties
2. WHEN testing game flows THEN the system SHALL include end-to-end integration tests covering complete game scenarios
3. WHEN testing error conditions THEN the system SHALL include tests for all error paths and edge cases
4. WHEN testing concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL include tests for race conditions and thread safety
5. WHEN measuring test coverage THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage for critical modules

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want all cryptographic operations to be implemented securely and validated thoroughly, so that the gaming protocol maintains its trustless guarantees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing hash commitments THEN the system SHALL use well-tested cryptographic libraries instead of custom implementations
2. WHEN validating user inputs THEN the system SHALL sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks
3. WHEN handling time-based operations THEN the system SHALL account for clock skew and implement proper timeout validation
4. WHEN processing events THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent denial-of-service attacks
5. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms and avoid logging sensitive information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want the codebase to follow consistent patterns and be well-structured, so that it's easy to understand, modify, and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new functionality THEN the code SHALL follow the Single Responsibility Principle with functions under 50 lines
2. WHEN defining constants THEN the system SHALL use configuration files or const declarations instead of magic numbers
3. WHEN handling different responsibilities THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into focused modules with clear interfaces
4. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL follow consistent formatting and naming conventions enforced by automated tools
5. WHEN documenting code THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive API documentation with examples

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want the system to provide observability and monitoring capabilities, so that I can detect issues and monitor system health in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL emit structured logs with appropriate log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL track performance metrics including latency and throughput
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error context including stack traces and correlation IDs
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL perform health checks and report readiness status
5. WHEN monitoring the system THEN operators SHALL be able to access metrics through standard monitoring interfaces

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the system to handle load efficiently and scale appropriately, so that it can support production traffic volumes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple requests THEN the system SHALL use efficient data structures and avoid O(n) lookups where possible
2. WHEN handling concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL implement proper connection pooling and resource management
3. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement streaming and pagination to avoid memory exhaustion
4. WHEN under load THEN the system SHALL implement backpressure mechanisms to prevent resource exhaustion
5. WHEN scaling horizontally THEN the system SHALL support stateless operation and external state storage
